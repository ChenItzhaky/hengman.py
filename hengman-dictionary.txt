I was just writing a suggestion, but i've deleted, because i've realised something. We aren't meant to have pages for the BE words
No not the words but if the name of an article happens to be the same as a BE (or defining vocabulary or Spache word) we should say so, as it marks a very basic concept every English reader must know. Mostly these will be disambiguation pages or those explaining complex alternative uses, e.g. boot, net, web, run. When you see on the screen of the computer at the school which you get minutes week on, it matters if you understand "no boot device", or can figure out what it is to "run" a program vs. to run in a soccer game. Likewise to catch fish in net vs. to get email over it. We forget how confusing this metaphor is, and how mixed (you access a non-spider web usually via the net, but the HTML files may be on your boot not data drive etc.). Imagine how confusing that lingo, which EVERYONE uses, ESPECIALLY new EN users, if we don't write at least those disambiguation articles. There won't be more than about 100 of them though. What Tango says here is exactly right:
The idea is everyone who comes to the site knows BE and we only have to explain NON BE words. The idea of being a dictionary was never meant to include definitions for the
I can't remember where it was discussed, probably SimpleTalk, but i seem to remember the conclusion was (although most of it was made before i got here) that we needed to be a dictionary as well as an encyclopedia so we could define the non-simple words that we would need to use in articles from time to time. There was never any intention of making definitions for the simple words. We may not want to control who comes here, but we must have an intended audience. In my view, that is people who already have a knowledge of simple english. We are not here to teach people english. If we want to help people learn english, we need to completely change the way we work.
I'm new to Simple English Wikipedia, but as an ESL teacher, I really don't like making nonexistent words (like "wordend") to explain things. Would those with more experience here agree that we can take out "wordend" in its two occurrences
"The idea is everyone who comes to the site knows BE and we only have to explain NON BE words. I say again: The users, contributors, and editors of this SEWiki are de facto anybody who can get to a WWW-capable terminal, can use it, and stumbles across this site. We *cannot* and presumably *should not try to* control "who comes to this site
